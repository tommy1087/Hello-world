# Hello-world
Hi, there, folks. My name is Tommy, and I'm a 21-year old student living in Dublin who has recently taken an interest in coding. I started off learning C, then progressed to C++, HTML, Css and, most recently, JavaScript. Now, I'm still at a novice level at all the languages that I have listed but I do enjoy building up my knowledge and hope to find support on this new platform
